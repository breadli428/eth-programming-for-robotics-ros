# ROS

This repository is a collection of codes I developed when following the course [Programming for Robotics - ROS](https://rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html) during my study at ETH, where I learnt to setup a communication system from scratch using ROS, to interface the individual sensors and actuators, and to implement closed loop control systems. The experiments were imeplemented on the [SMB robot](https://ethz-robotx.github.io/SuperMegaBot) in a simulated environment.


The included technical practices and tools are
- TF tranformation system
- Gazebo
- RViz
- rqt
- ROS 2
